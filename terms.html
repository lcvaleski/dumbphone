            <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 48px; font-size: 42px;">Terms of Service</h1>

            <div class="tos-content">
                <h3>1. Service Overview</h3>
                <p>CorePhone, operated by Coventry Labs LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), provides professionally configured iPhone devices with permanent parental controls. By purchasing our service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms").</p>

                <h3>2. Device Configuration</h3>
                <p>Our configuration service permanently restricts app installation and website access based on your selections during the ordering process. These restrictions are designed to be permanent and cannot be removed without our assistance. You understand and accept that:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 24px; line-height: 1.7;">
                    <li>The restrictions are intended to be permanent</li>
                    <li>Factory resets will not remove the restrictions if Find My is enabled</li>
                    <li>Removing restrictions requires shipping the device back to us</li>
                    <li>This permanence is the core feature of our service</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Privacy & Data Protection</h3>
                <p>We take your privacy seriously. Our configuration:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 24px; line-height: 1.7;">
                    <li>Does not monitor or access personal data on configured devices</li>
                    <li>Does not track messages, calls, or personal communications</li>
                    <li>Does not access photos, files, or personal content</li>
                    <li>Does not collect location data or browsing history</li>
                    <li>Only controls which apps can be installed and which websites can be accessed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We collect only the information necessary to process your order and configure your device according to your specifications.</p>

                <h3>4. Returns & Refunds</h3>
                <p>We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all purchases. To be eligible for a return:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 24px; line-height: 1.7;">
                    <li>Contact us within 30 days of receiving your device</li>
                    <li>Return the device in its original condition with all accessories</li>

                    <li>Pay for return shipping costs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To initiate a return, contact support@coventrylabs.net with your order number and reason for return.</p>

                <h3>5. Warranty & Support</h3>
                <p>All new devices come with Apple's standard 1-year limited warranty. This covers hardware defects but does not cover:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 24px; line-height: 1.7;">
                    <li>Physical damage from drops or accidents</li>
                    <li>Water damage</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized modifications</li>
                    <li>Normal wear and tear</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Configuration support is provided free of charge for the lifetime of the device. If you need to reinstall configurations after a factory reset, you are responsible for shipping costs both ways.</p>

                <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 24px; line-height: 1.7;">
                    <li>CorePhone is not responsible for any data loss during device setup or configuration</li>
                    <li>We recommend backing up all data before transferring to a configured device</li>
                    <li>Our total liability shall not exceed the purchase price of the device</li>
                    <li>We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. Age Restrictions & Parental Responsibility</h3>

                    <li>You accept full responsibility for the configuration choices you make</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Acceptable Use</h3>

                    <li>Misrepresent the nature of the restrictions to the device user</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9. Order Processing & Delivery</h3>
